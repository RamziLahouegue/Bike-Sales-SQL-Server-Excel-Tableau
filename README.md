# Bike-Sales-SQL-Server-Excel-Tableau

The management of a company that sells bikes wants to know the conditions of the sales activities within the company and gain insights into the various trends happening, and the sales volumes over the 2016-2018 period. They also want to know the revenues per region, per store, per product category and per bike brand. Furthermore, they want a list of the top customers and sales reps.

We will firstly use SQL Server to explore the dataset, and perform queries to help answer management's questions. We will then connect the SQL query results (Dataset) to Microsoft Excel to create an insightful interactive dashboard featuring PivotTables, PivotCharts, Graphs and more. Lastly, we will connect the Excel dataset to Tableau Public to create another interactive dashboard.
